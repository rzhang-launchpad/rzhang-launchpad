ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Romy!
 
Currently, my goal is to learn JavaScript. Typescript, too, probably.

Python, HTML, and CSS are to come.

I got interested in coding after working in quality assurance for a big software project! I was impressed by how fast the developers would be able to identify and solve problems.

I'd show them a screenshot, and they'd immediately be like *"Oh, that must be XYZ not doing ABC..."*

So, I thought, *Hey, if I'm here, I might as well learn some basic coding so I can better identify issues and understand what's going on.*

So here I am.
